QA and Audit Rules

- Always run an AI QA audit
  - Use `context/audit-template.md` to structure findings per feature.
  - The audit reports issues; fixes are applied deliberately in follow-up diffs.

- Acceptance criteria verification
  - Trace each criterion to code and UI behavior.
  - Include unhappy-path checks (invalid zips, duplicates, conflicting overrides).

- Tests
  - Add or update unit tests near logic-heavy modules when feasible.
  - Favor small, deterministic tests for validation and reducers/selectors.

- PR hygiene
  - One logical concern per PR; keep diffs readable.
  - Screenshots or short screen-caps for UX flows help reviewers.
