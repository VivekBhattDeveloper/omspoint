Additional rules
- Loader must throw when reconciliation not found; do not fall back to sample data here.
- Keep `reconciliationStatusClasses` in sync with status enum values; update colors if new states introduced.
- Redirect path (`/admin/finance/reconciliation`) must stay aligned with index route.
- Guard optional order fields before formatting totals/dates to avoid runtime errors.
