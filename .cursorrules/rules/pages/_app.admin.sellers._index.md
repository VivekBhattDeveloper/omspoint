Additional rules
- Any destructive action must prompt for confirmation and propagate toast feedback; never delete silently.
- Keep loader fallback path intactâ€”log errors and maintain `isSample` flag so UI can present the alert.
- Maintain keyboard navigation (row `tabIndex` + enter/space handlers) whenever table interactions change.
- If pagination is introduced, emit metrics on total sellers and surface vendor filters rather than removing the vendor column.
