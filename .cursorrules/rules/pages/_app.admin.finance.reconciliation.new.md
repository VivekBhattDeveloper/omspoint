Route file: web/routes/_app.admin.finance.reconciliation.new.tsx
Additional rules
- Keep cancel navigation using router history (`navigate(-1)`) instead of hard reloads.
- If more fields are added, ensure they exist on the financeReconciliation model and stay within autoform metadata.
- Redirect path (`/admin/finance/reconciliation`) must stay in sync with index route; update both together if routing changes.
