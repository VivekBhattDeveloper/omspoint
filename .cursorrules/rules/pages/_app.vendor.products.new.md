Additional rules
- Preserve the cancel navigation (router-based) to avoid full reloads; keep it in sync with detail routes.
- Ensure new fields added to vendorProduct schema get wired in both create and edit forms simultaneously.
- Avoid adding expensive client-side defaults—prefer server defaults defined on the model.
- When nested collections grow, consider pagination or collapsed accordions to maintain performance.
