Title: Adopt phase-driven AI dev workflow for complex forms

Source: "How I built the Zone Details form for Nuflorist" by Jean Manzo (2025-09-19)

Purpose
- Capture the article’s process and constraints as first-class project context.
- Guide AI-assisted work to be precise, auditable, and safe.
- Keep changes aligned with existing code style and UX patterns.

Scope
- Applies to feature work that involves non-trivial UI forms, validation, draft/publish flows, duplication/deletion, and pricing overrides.
- Non-binding to implementation details; prioritize existing patterns in this repo unless explicitly approved to change.

Tech assumptions (current repo)
- React 18 with React Router routes in `web/` and shadcn/ui components in `web/components/ui`.
- Gadget backend models under `api/models/*` with actions and schemas.
- TypeScript-first; keep types sound and narrow surface area of changes.

Outcome
- Faster delivery via structured phases.
- Higher quality via explicit acceptance criteria and audits.
- Lower risk via tight diff discipline and reversible changes.
