Title: _public._index page
Route file: web/routes/_public._index.tsx
Suggested path: /public

Role/Purpose
- Default public landing hero shown to developers installing the app; points them to the Gadget editor.

Primary UI Components
- Single hero section with headline, description copy, and `Button` linking to Gadget file editor.
- `Pencil` icon from lucide-react paired with CTA.

Data Dependencies
- Purely static content; no loader or API usage.

Actions & Side Effects
- CTA opens `/edit/files/web/routes/_public._index.tsx` in a new tab for rapid editing.

Acceptance Criteria
- Page renders centered hero content across viewports.
- CTA link opens editor in new tab and retains icon + label.
- No runtime errors when server-side rendering since there are no hooks.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Load `/public` and ensure hero renders with emoji headline.
- Manual: Click edit button to verify Gadget editor opens in new tab.

Notes
- Replace with real marketing/landing content when app branding is defined.
