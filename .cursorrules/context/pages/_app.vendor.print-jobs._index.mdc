Title: _app.vendor.print-jobs._index page
Route file: web/routes/_app.vendor.print-jobs._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/vendor/print-jobs

Role/Purpose
- Monitor print pipeline with search and status filtering; navigate to job details.
- Enable vendors to track print job status, search by job ID or order ID, and navigate to job details.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Print Jobs" and description.
- `Card` wrapping print jobs table with header and description.
- Search `Input` for filtering by print job ID or order ID (client-side).
- Status filter `Select` (All statuses, Pending, Printing, Complete, Failed).
- Optional `Alert` banner when `isSample === true` showing "Sample dataset" message with error details.
- Custom `Table` component from `@/components/ui/table` with columns: Print Job, Status, Print date, Order.
- Table rows use `StatusBadge` component for status display and are keyboard accessible.

Data Dependencies
- Loader calls `context.api.printJob.findMany()` with select: `id`, `printJobId`, `status`, `printDate`, `order.orderId`.
- Sorted by `printDate: "Descending"`, limited to `first: 250`.
- On error, returns `sampleJobs` array (3 curated records) with `isSample: true` and `errorMessage`.
- Jobs mapped to `LoaderPrintJob` type with normalized values.

Actions & Side Effects
- Search input filters jobs client-side by print job ID or order ID (case-insensitive, trimmed).
- Status filter filters jobs by status (client-side).
- Table row click/keyboard activation navigates to `/vendor/print-jobs/:id`.
- Alert displays when showing sample data with error message surfaced.
- Filters work together (both search and status must match).

Acceptance Criteria
- Loader handles API success and failure gracefully with sample data fallback.
- Sample data fallback shows alert with error message when API unavailable.
- Search filters jobs by print job ID or order ID correctly.
- Status filter filters jobs correctly and works with search.
- Table renders job ID, status badge, formatted print date, and order ID.
- Status badges use `StatusBadge` component with `kind="printJob"` for consistent styling.
- Row click/keyboard navigation works correctly to detail page.
- Empty state shows "No print jobs match the current filters." when filtered array is empty.
- Date formatting uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with medium date and short time styles.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Simulate API failure to verify sample data + alert appears.
- Manual: Test search filtering with various print job IDs and order IDs.
- Manual: Test status filter with various statuses.
- Manual: Test combined search + status filter.
- Manual: Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space) on table rows.
- Manual: Verify row click navigates to detail page.
- Unit: Test filtering logic with edge cases (empty search, no status filter, etc.).
- E2E: Test full flow from list → search → filter → detail navigation.

Notes
- Loader implements robust error handling with sample data fallback pattern.
- Custom Table component used instead of AutoTable for better control and accessibility.
- Client-side filtering for responsive UX without server round-trips.
- Status badges use `StatusBadge` component for consistent styling across the app.
- Consider pagination when job volume exceeds 250 records.
- Consider server-side filtering if volume grows significantly.
