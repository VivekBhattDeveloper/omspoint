Title: _app.admin.audit._index page
Route file: web/routes/_app.admin.audit._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/admin/audit

Role/Purpose
- Provide comprehensive audit and compliance dashboard covering audit events, compliance exports, scheduled reports, approval requests, and control checkpoints.
- Enable administrators to track all system changes, monitor compliance workflows, and review approval processes.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Audit & Compliance" and description.
- `Tabs` component with five tabs: Audit Events, Compliance Exports, Scheduled Reports, Approval Requests, Control Checkpoints.
- Model filter `Select` for audit events (All models, or specific model).
- Search `Input` for filtering audit events.
- Custom `Table` components in each tab showing relevant records with status badges, formatted dates, and action buttons.
- Status badges with color coding: info=blue, warning=amber, critical=rose, recorded=emerald, awaiting_approval=amber, rejected=rose.
- Download buttons for compliance exports and scheduled reports.

Data Dependencies
- Loader calls five parallel API queries: `context.api.auditEvent.findMany()`, `context.api.complianceExport.findMany()`, `context.api.scheduledReport.findMany()`, `context.api.approvalRequest.findMany()`, `context.api.controlCheckpoint.findMany()`.
- Audit events select: `id`, `timestamp`, `actor`, `actorRole`, `model`, `action`, `target`, `status`, `severity`, `channel`, `diffSummary`, `changeTicket`, `evidencePack` (first 250, sorted by timestamp descending).
- Compliance exports select: `id`, `name`, `description`, `coverage`, `formats`, `lastGenerated`, `owner`, `status` (first 100, sorted by lastGenerated descending).
- Scheduled reports select: `id`, `name`, `audience`, `frequency`, `nextRun`, `channel`, `format`, `owner`, `status` (first 100, sorted by nextRun ascending).
- Approval requests select: `id`, `title`, `submittedBy`, `submittedAt`, `policy`, `risk`, `context`, `pendingApprovers`, `evidence`, `status` (first 100, sorted by submittedAt descending).
- Control checkpoints select: `id`, `name`, `control`, `owner`, `status`, `lastValidated`, `coverage`, `notes` (first 100, sorted by name ascending).
- All queries use `.catch(() => [])` to handle failures gracefully, returning empty arrays.
- Records normalized with type guard functions to ensure type safety.

Actions & Side Effects
- Tab switching updates visible content (client-side).
- Model filter filters audit events by model name (client-side).
- Search input filters audit events by actor/action/target (client-side).
- Download buttons for compliance exports and scheduled reports (stub implementation).
- No mutations yet—page is read-only audit view.

Acceptance Criteria
- Loader handles API success and failure gracefully (empty arrays on failure).
- All five API queries execute in parallel via `Promise.all`.
- Tabs switch correctly between all five categories.
- Model filter correctly filters audit events.
- Search input filters audit events across multiple fields.
- Status badges display with correct colors based on status/severity.
- Date formatting uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` consistently.
- Empty states handle gracefully when no records in a category.
- Risk level badges display correctly (low=emerald, medium=amber, high=rose).

QA & Tests
- Manual: Simulate API failure to verify empty arrays handled gracefully.
- Manual: Verify all five tabs load and display data correctly.
- Manual: Test model filter with various model selections.
- Manual: Test search input with various query strings.
- Manual: Check status badge colors match record status/severity.
- Manual: Check date formatting displays correctly.
- Unit: Test type guard functions and normalization logic.
- E2E: Test tab switching, filtering, and search interactions.

Notes
- Loader implements robust error handling with graceful degradation (empty arrays).
- Parallel API queries improve load time.
- Type guard functions ensure type safety when normalizing API records.
- Client-side filtering provides responsive UX without server round-trips.
- Consider adding server-side filtering/pagination for large audit event volumes.
- Consider adding export functionality for audit events.
- Consider adding approval action buttons in future iterations.
