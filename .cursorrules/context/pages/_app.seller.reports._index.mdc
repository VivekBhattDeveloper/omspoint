Route file: web/routes/_app.seller.reports._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/seller/reports

Role/Purpose
- Provide seller-facing reports interface with sales overview, channel breakdown, assortment performance, compliance monitoring, and settlement tracking.
- Enable sellers to track sales metrics, monitor channel performance, assess compliance, and review settlement cycles.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Reports" and description.
- Sales overview cards: Total GMV, Order count, Average order value, Delivered rate, Pending count, Cancelled count, GMV change.
- Trend chart/table showing daily sales over 14-day period.
- Channel breakdown table: Channel, Payment method, GMV, Orders, Share.
- Assortment performance table: Name, GMV, Orders, Share, Last order date.
- Compliance section: Summary (healthy, monitor, action counts), Listings table, Tasks table.
- Settlements section: Summary (cycles, orders, amount), Cycles table, Next payout card.
- Status badges: healthy, monitor, action, Complete, In progress, Attention needed.

Data Dependencies
- Loader calls `context.api.order.findMany()` with filter for last 30 days, selecting: `id`, `orderDate`, `status`, `channel`, `total`, `payment.paymentMethod`, `sellerProduct.assortment.id`, `sellerProduct.assortment.name` (first 250, sorted by orderDate descending).
- Loader aggregates order data to compute sales overview, trends, channel breakdown, assortment performance, compliance scores, and settlement cycles.
- Trend computed over `TREND_DAYS = 14` period.
- Compliance scores computed with minimum threshold `MIN_COMPLIANCE_SCORE = 35`.
- Weekly summaries use ISO week calculation (`getIsoWeek` helper).
- On API error, orders array defaults to empty array (graceful degradation).

Actions & Side Effects
- No mutations—page is read-only reporting view.
- Data computed client-side from aggregated order data.

Acceptance Criteria
- Loader handles API success and failure gracefully (empty orders array on error).
- Sales overview metrics accurately reflect order data (GMV, order count, AOV, delivered rate).
- Trend data displays correctly over 14-day period.
- Channel breakdown aggregates correctly by channel and payment method.
- Assortment performance aggregates correctly by assortment.
- Compliance scores computed correctly with minimum threshold.
- Settlement cycles grouped correctly by ISO week.
- Status badges display with correct colors based on status values.
- Empty states handle gracefully when no data exists.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Verify loader handles API success and failure gracefully.
- Manual: Test sales overview calculations match order data.
- Manual: Verify trend data aggregates correctly over 14-day period.
- Manual: Test channel breakdown aggregates correctly.
- Manual: Test assortment performance aggregates correctly.
- Manual: Verify compliance scores computed correctly.
- Manual: Test settlement cycles grouped correctly by ISO week.
- Unit: Test helper calculations (`getIsoWeek`, `formatDay`, `safeDate`).
- Unit: Test aggregation logic for sales, channels, assortments.
- E2E: Test report rendering with various data scenarios.

Notes
- Loader implements robust error handling with graceful degradation (empty orders array).
- Order metrics computed client-side from aggregated order data.
- Weekly summaries use ISO week calculation for consistent grouping.
- Compliance scores use minimum threshold for action items.
- Trend period configurable via `TREND_DAYS` constant.
- Consider adding date range picker for custom reporting periods.
- Consider adding CSV export functionality in future iterations.
- Consider adding chart visualizations for trends in future iterations.
