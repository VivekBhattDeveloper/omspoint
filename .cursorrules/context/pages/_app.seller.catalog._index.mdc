Title: _app.seller.catalog._index page
Route file: web/routes/_app.seller.catalog._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/seller/catalog

Role/Purpose
- Provide seller-facing catalog management interface with attribute mapping, channel sync status, and validation guardrails.
- Enable sellers to manage catalog SKUs, track attribute mappings, monitor channel syncs, and ensure compliance.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Catalog Management" and description.
- Summary metric cards: Catalog SKUs, Mapped attributes, Marketplace syncs, Policy coverage.
- Active filters display showing current filter selections.
- Saved views cards showing pre-configured catalog views.
- Custom `Table` components showing attribute mappings, channel sync status, and validation results.
- Status badges: complete, in-progress, needs-attention, healthy, syncing, blocked, pass, watch, fail.
- Progress bars for mapping coverage and policy coverage.
- Action buttons: Refresh, Filter, Upload.

Data Dependencies
- Currently uses client-side sample data (no loader yet).
- Sample data includes: summary metrics, active filters, saved views, attribute mappings, channel sync status, validation guardrails.
- Data defined as constants and computed from sample structures.

Actions & Side Effects
- Filter actions: Update active filters (client-side state updates).
- Saved view selection: Apply saved view filters (client-side state updates).
- Refresh button: Triggers catalog refresh (stub implementation, shows toast).
- Upload button: Opens upload dialog (stub implementation).
- No mutations yet—page is read-only monitoring view.

Acceptance Criteria
- Page renders with sample data showing catalog metrics, filters, and mappings.
- Summary metrics display correctly (SKU count, mapped attributes, syncs, coverage).
- Active filters display current selections.
- Saved views display pre-configured catalog views.
- Attribute mapping table shows channel, feed attribute, catalog source, coverage, status.
- Channel sync status displays connection health and sync times.
- Validation guardrails show compliance status and gaps.
- Status badges display with correct colors based on status values.
- Progress bars display coverage percentages correctly.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Verify all sections load with sample data.
- Manual: Test filter actions update active filters correctly.
- Manual: Test saved view selection applies filters correctly.
- Manual: Test refresh action (stub implementation).
- Manual: Test upload action (stub implementation).
- Manual: Check status badge colors match record status.
- Future: Add loader to fetch real catalog data from API once models are available.
- Future: Add API mutations for catalog operations once backend is ready.
- Future: Add unit tests for filter logic and status badge rendering.

Notes
- Currently uses client-side sample data—needs loader implementation once catalog models are available.
- Status badge configurations use consistent color schemes across all sections.
- Progress bars provide visual feedback for coverage metrics.
- Saved views provide quick access to common catalog configurations.
- Consider adding real-time sync status indicators in future iterations.
- Consider adding bulk catalog operations in future iterations.
- Consider adding catalog validation rules configuration in future iterations.
