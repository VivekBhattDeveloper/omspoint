Title: _app.vendor.returns._index page
Route file: web/routes/_app.vendor.returns._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/vendor/returns

Role/Purpose
- Provide vendor-facing returns management interface with RMA tracking, fulfillment actions, courier feedback, and integration status.
- Enable vendors to process returns, track fulfillment actions, and manage courier disputes.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Returns Management" and description.
- `Tabs` component with four tabs: Returns Queue, Fulfillment Actions, Courier Feedback, Integration Status.
- Custom `Table` components in each tab showing relevant records with status badges and formatted values.
- Returns Queue table: RMA #, Order, Status, Reason, Channel, Customer, Courier, Tracking, Last update, SLA due, Disposition, Issue summary, Item SKU, Quantity, Value.
- Fulfillment Actions table: RMA #, Type, Owner team, Status, Due date, Instructions.
- Courier Feedback table: RMA #, Carrier, Milestone, Dispute status, Response due, Last update, Notes.
- Integration Status card showing provider, status, last sync, ticket count, linked queues.
- Status badges with color coding: awaitingVendor=indigo, inspectionPending=amber, restockPending=emerald, reprintPending=sky, completed=slate, awaitingEvidence=amber, evidenceSubmitted=indigo, resolved=emerald.

Data Dependencies
- Currently uses client-side sample data (no loader yet).
- Sample data includes: returns (5 records), fulfillment actions (3 records), courier feedback (3 records), integration state (1 record).
- Data computed via helper functions (`buildReturns()`, `buildActionQueue()`, `buildCourierFeedback()`, `buildIntegrationState()`) with date calculations using `date-fns` functions.

Actions & Side Effects
- Tab switching updates visible content (client-side).
- No mutations yet—page is read-only monitoring view.
- Relative date formatting uses `formatDistanceToNowStrict` from `date-fns`.
- Status badges use helper functions for consistent formatting.

Acceptance Criteria
- Page renders with sample data showing returns, actions, courier feedback, and integration status.
- Tabs switch correctly between all four categories.
- Status badges display with correct colors based on status values.
- Relative dates format correctly (e.g., "3 hours ago").
- Reason codes display with labels and descriptions.
- Dispute status badges show correct colors and formatted text.
- Integration status card displays provider connection health.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Verify all four tabs load and display data correctly.
- Manual: Test tab switching between all categories.
- Manual: Check status badge colors match record status.
- Manual: Verify relative date formatting displays correctly.
- Manual: Check reason code labels and descriptions display correctly.
- Future: Add loader to fetch real returns data from API once models are available.
- Future: Add unit tests for date calculations and status badge logic.

Notes
- Currently uses client-side sample data—needs loader implementation once returns models are available.
- Status badge configurations use consistent color schemes across all tabs.
- Reason codes provide clear labels and descriptions for return reasons.
- Courier feedback tracks dispute status and response deadlines.
- Integration status shows connection health for returns management system.
- Consider adding filtering/search within each tab for large datasets.
- Consider adding mutation actions (update return status, submit courier evidence) in future iterations.
