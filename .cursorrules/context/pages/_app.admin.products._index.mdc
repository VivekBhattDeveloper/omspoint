Title: _app.admin.products._index page
Route file: web/routes/_app.admin.products._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/admin/products

Role/Purpose
- Provide an overview of catalog SKUs with KPIs (totals, coverage, average price) and a navigable table.
- Enable creating a new product and navigating to product detail for edits.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Product Catalog", dynamic description showing total count, and "New product" button action.
- Optional `Alert` banner when `isSample === true` showing "Sample dataset" message with error details.
- Three KPI `Card`s displaying: Total SKUs (with attached/unassigned breakdown), Order coverage percentage, Average price.
- `Card`-wrapped custom `Table` component from `@/components/ui/table` with columns: Name, Price, Order, Description, Status.
- Table rows are keyboard accessible (tabIndex, Enter/Space handlers) and clickable.

Data Dependencies
- Loader calls `context.api.product.findMany()` with select: `id`, `productName`, `price`, `productDescription.truncatedHTML`, `order.id`, `order.orderId`.
- Sorted by `createdAt: "Descending"`, limited to `first: 250`.
- Computes stats via `calculateStats()` helper: `total`, `attached`, `unattached`, `averagePrice`.
- On error, returns `sampleProducts` array (3 curated records) with `isSample: true` and `errorMessage`.
- Products mapped to `LoaderProduct` type with `isAttached` boolean derived from order presence.

Actions & Side Effects
- "New product" button navigates to `/admin/products/new`.
- Table row click/keyboard activation navigates to `/admin/products/:id`.
- Alert displays when showing sample data with error message surfaced.

Acceptance Criteria
- Loader handles API success and failure gracefully with sample data fallback.
- KPI cards reflect current data correctly: totals, attached/unassigned counts, average price calculation.
- Sample data fallback shows alert with error message when API unavailable.
- Table renders key fields (name, price, order, description HTML, status badge).
- Row click/keyboard navigation works correctly to detail page.
- New product button navigates to create page.
- Empty state shows "No products found." when array is empty.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Simulate API failure to verify sample data + alert appears.
- Manual: Verify KPI calculations match table data (attached count, average price).
- Manual: Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space) on table rows.
- Manual: Verify row click navigates to detail page.
- Unit: Test `calculateStats` helper with various product arrays.
- E2E: Test full flow from list → row click → detail navigation.

Notes
- Loader implements robust error handling with sample data fallback pattern.
- Custom Table component used instead of AutoTable for better control and accessibility.
- Description HTML is truncated and displayed with `line-clamp-1`.
- Status badge shows "Attached" or "Unassigned" based on order relationship.
- Consider pagination when product volume exceeds 250 records.
