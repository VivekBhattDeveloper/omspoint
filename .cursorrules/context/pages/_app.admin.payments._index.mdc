Title: _app.admin.payments._index page
Route file: web/routes/_app.admin.payments._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/admin/payments

Role/Purpose
- Provide payment ledger overview with KPIs (total volume, most used method, latest capture) and a navigable payment table.
- Enable logging new payments and navigating to payment details for reconciliation.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Payments", dynamic description showing total count and volume, and "Log payment" button action.
- Optional `Alert` banner when `isSample === true` showing "Sample dataset" message with error details.
- Three KPI `Card`s displaying: Total volume (with method breakdown), Most used method badge, Latest capture date/time.
- `Card`-wrapped custom `Table` component from `@/components/ui/table` with columns: Amount, Method, Captured, Order.
- Table rows are keyboard accessible and clickable.

Data Dependencies
- Loader calls `context.api.payment.findMany()` with select: `id`, `amount`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentDate`, `order.orderId`.
- Sorted by `paymentDate: "Descending"`, limited to `first: 250`.
- Computes stats via `computeStats()` helper: `total`, `totalVolume` (sum of amounts), `latestPaymentDate`, `methodCounts` (record of method -> count).
- On error, returns `samplePayments` array (3 curated records) with `isSample: true` and `errorMessage`.
- Payments mapped to `LoaderPayment` type with normalized amount values.

Actions & Side Effects
- "Log payment" button navigates to `/admin/payments/new`.
- Table row click/keyboard activation navigates to `/admin/payments/:id`.
- Alert displays when showing sample data with error message surfaced.
- Method badges display with uppercase styling and proper formatting.

Acceptance Criteria
- Loader handles API success and failure gracefully with sample data fallback.
- KPI cards reflect current data: total volume calculation, method counts, latest payment date.
- Sample data fallback shows alert with error message when API unavailable.
- Table renders formatted currency amounts, method badges, formatted dates, and order IDs.
- Amount formatting uses `Intl.NumberFormat` with currency style (USD).
- Row click/keyboard navigation works correctly to detail page.
- New payment button navigates to create page.
- Empty state shows "No payments recorded." when array is empty.
- Method badges display with uppercase tracking-wide styling.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Simulate API failure to verify sample data + alert appears.
- Manual: Verify KPI calculations match table data (total volume, method counts).
- Manual: Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space) on table rows.
- Manual: Verify row click navigates to detail page.
- Manual: Check currency formatting displays correctly.
- Unit: Test `computeStats` helper with various payment arrays.
- E2E: Test full flow from list → row click → detail navigation.

Notes
- Loader implements robust error handling with sample data fallback pattern.
- Custom Table component used instead of AutoTable for better control and accessibility.
- Currency formatting uses tabular-nums for consistent alignment.
- Method badges use variant="outline" with uppercase tracking-wide text-xs styling.
- Consider pagination when payment volume exceeds 250 records.
