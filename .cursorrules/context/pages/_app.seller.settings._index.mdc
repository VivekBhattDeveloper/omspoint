Title: _app.seller.settings._index page
Route file: web/routes/_app.seller.settings._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/seller/settings

Role/Purpose
- Configure warehouse addresses, escalation contacts, and channel SLAs for seller operations.
- Enable sellers to manage fulfillment addresses, contact information, and service level agreements.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Seller Settings" and description.
- Multiple `Card` components for: Warehouse Addresses, Escalation Contacts, Channel SLAs.
- `Dialog` components for adding addresses and contacts.
- Custom `Table` components showing addresses, contacts, and SLAs.
- Form inputs: `Input`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Textarea`, `Label`.
- Action buttons: Add, Edit, Delete, Set default, Toggle primary.
- Toast notifications for user feedback.

Data Dependencies
- Loader currently returns seeded client-side data via `createChannelConfigSeed()` helper.
- Seed data includes: warehouse addresses, escalation contacts, channel SLAs.
- Loader function `loadSellerSettings()` has TODO comment: "Replace seed data with seller settings fetched from finance/SLA services once APIs are available."
- State managed client-side via `useState` hooks for each data category.

Actions & Side Effects
- Add warehouse address: Opens dialog, validates required fields, adds to state, shows toast, closes dialog.
- Add escalation contact: Opens dialog, validates required fields, adds to state, shows toast, closes dialog.
- Delete address: Confirms deletion, removes from state, shows toast.
- Delete contact: Confirms deletion, removes from state, shows toast.
- Set default address: Updates state, shows toast.
- Toggle primary contact: Updates state, shows toast.
- Update channel SLA: Updates state, shows toast.
- All mutations are client-side only—no API calls yet.

Acceptance Criteria
- Page renders with seeded data showing addresses, contacts, and SLAs.
- Add address dialog validates required fields and adds address to state.
- Add contact dialog validates required fields and adds contact to state.
- Delete actions prompt for confirmation before removing items.
- Set default/toggle primary actions update state correctly and show toast feedback.
- Only one address can be default at a time.
- Only one contact can be primary at a time.
- Channel SLA updates persist in state correctly.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Verify all sections load with seeded data.
- Manual: Test add address flow (valid/invalid inputs).
- Manual: Test add contact flow (valid/invalid inputs).
- Manual: Test delete actions with confirmation prompts.
- Manual: Test set default address (ensures only one default).
- Manual: Test toggle primary contact (ensures only one primary).
- Manual: Test channel SLA updates.
- Manual: Verify toast notifications appear for all actions.
- Future: Add loader to fetch real settings from API once models are available.
- Future: Add API mutations for all actions once backend is ready.
- Future: Add unit tests for state management and validation logic.

Notes
- Currently uses client-side seeded data—needs loader implementation once seller settings models are available.
- All mutations are client-side only—needs API integration once backend actions are ready.
- TODO comment in loader indicates future API integration.
- State management uses `useState` hooks with cloned arrays/objects to avoid mutations.
- Dialog forms validate required fields before submission.
- Toast notifications provide user feedback for all actions.
- Address types include: fulfillment, returns, pickup.
- Consider adding edit functionality for existing addresses/contacts in future iterations.
- Consider adding address validation via geocoding service in future iterations.
