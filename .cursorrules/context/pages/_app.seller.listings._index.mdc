Suggested path: /app/seller/listings

Role/Purpose
- Provide seller-facing marketplace listings management interface with channel health monitoring, sync service status, and listing management.
- Enable sellers to monitor listing status, track channel health, manage sync services, and handle listing issues.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Marketplace Listings" and description.
- Summary cards showing total listings, published, pending, error, paused, flagged, repricing counts.
- Channel health cards showing total, published, pending, error, paused counts per channel.
- Sync service cards showing connection status, last sync, attention count.
- Custom `Table` component showing listings with columns: Label, Channel, Status, Issues, Last order, Last sync, Orders, Price, Price change, Repricing, Compliance score, Flagged, Suggested action.
- Status badges: published, pending, error, paused.
- Action buttons: Refresh, Sync, Pause, Resume.

Data Dependencies
- Loader calls `context.api.order.findMany()` with filter for last 30 days, selecting: `id`, `orderDate`, `status`, `channel`, `total`, `payment.paymentMethod`, `printJob.status` (first 200, sorted by orderDate descending).
- Loader aggregates order data by channel to compute listing metrics (totalOrders, pendingOrders, lastOrderDate).
- Channel labels mapped: creditCard=Amazon, paypal=Shopify, bankTransfer=Walmart.
- Listing status computed from order data and sync status.
- On API error, orders array defaults to empty array (graceful degradation).

Actions & Side Effects
- Refresh button: Triggers sync (stub implementation, shows toast).
- Sync button: Triggers channel sync (stub implementation, shows toast).
- Pause/Resume buttons: Update listing status (client-side state updates, toast feedback).
- Search and filter update visible listings (client-side).
- All mutations are client-side only—no API calls yet.

Acceptance Criteria
- Loader handles API success and failure gracefully (empty orders array on error).
- Summary cards display correct counts computed from listing data.
- Channel health cards show correct metrics per channel.
- Sync service cards display connection status and last sync times.
- Listing table displays all relevant fields with correct formatting.
- Status badges display correctly based on listing status.
- Price change indicators show correct direction and percentage.
- Compliance scores display with appropriate color coding.
- Empty states handle gracefully when no listings exist.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Verify loader handles API success and failure gracefully.
- Manual: Test summary card calculations match listing data.
- Manual: Verify channel health metrics aggregate correctly.
- Manual: Test sync service status displays correctly.
- Manual: Test refresh and sync actions (stub implementations).
- Manual: Test pause/resume actions update state correctly.
- Future: Add API mutations for sync actions once backend is ready.
- Future: Add unit tests for order aggregation and metric calculations.
- Future: Add E2E tests for listing management flows.

Notes
- Loader implements robust error handling with graceful degradation (empty orders array).
- Order metrics computed client-side from aggregated order data.
- Channel labels mapped to human-readable names.
- Listing status computed from order data and sync status.
- All mutations are client-side only—needs API integration once backend actions are ready.
- Status badges use consistent color schemes (published=emerald, pending=amber, error=rose, paused=slate).
- Consider adding real-time sync status indicators in future iterations.
- Consider adding bulk actions for listing management in future iterations.
