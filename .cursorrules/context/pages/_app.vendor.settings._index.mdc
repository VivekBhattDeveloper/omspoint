Title: _app.vendor.settings._index page
Route file: web/routes/_app.vendor.settings._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/vendor/settings

Role/Purpose
- Configure payout accounts, compliance documents, escalation contacts, and notification routing for vendor operations.
- Enable vendors to manage financial accounts, compliance documentation, and communication preferences.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Vendor Settings" and description.
- Multiple `Card` components for: Payout Accounts, Compliance Documents, Escalation Contacts, Notification Preferences, Next Actions.
- `Dialog` components for adding payout accounts and compliance documents.
- Custom `Table` components showing accounts, documents, contacts, and notifications.
- Form inputs: `Input`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Textarea`, `Label`.
- Status badges for account/document status.
- Action buttons: Add, Edit, Delete, Toggle primary, Toggle flags.
- Toast notifications for user feedback.

Data Dependencies
- Loader currently returns seeded client-side data via `createSeedVendorSettings()` helper.
- Seed data includes: payout accounts (2 accounts), compliance documents (3 documents), escalation contacts (3 contacts), notification preferences (3 preferences), next actions (5 actions).
- Loader function `loadVendorSettings()` has TODO comment: "Source vendor payout/compliance configuration from Gadget actions once services are online."
- State managed client-side via `useState` hooks for each data category.

Actions & Side Effects
- Add payout account: Opens dialog, validates required fields, adds to state, shows toast, closes dialog.
- Add compliance document: Opens dialog, validates required fields, adds to state, shows toast, closes dialog.
- Delete payout account: Confirms deletion, removes from state, shows toast.
- Delete compliance document: Confirms deletion, removes from state, shows toast.
- Toggle primary account: Updates state, shows toast.
- Toggle auto-payout/same-day flags: Updates state, shows toast.
- Toggle notification preferences: Updates state, shows toast.
- All mutations are client-side only—no API calls yet.

Acceptance Criteria
- Page renders with seeded data showing accounts, documents, contacts, notifications, and next actions.
- Add payout account dialog validates required fields and adds account to state.
- Add compliance document dialog validates required fields and adds document to state.
- Delete actions prompt for confirmation before removing items.
- Toggle actions update state correctly and show toast feedback.
- Only one account can be primary at a time.
- Status badges display correctly (Active, Pending, Suspended, Approved, Pending, Expired).
- Next actions show status badges (Todo, In progress, Complete).

QA & Tests
- Manual: Verify all sections load with seeded data.
- Manual: Test add payout account flow (valid/invalid inputs).
- Manual: Test add compliance document flow (valid/invalid inputs).
- Manual: Test delete actions with confirmation prompts.
- Manual: Test toggle primary account (ensures only one primary).
- Manual: Test toggle flags (auto-payout, same-day, notification preferences).
- Manual: Verify toast notifications appear for all actions.
- Future: Add loader to fetch real settings from API once models are available.
- Future: Add API mutations for all actions once backend is ready.
- Future: Add unit tests for state management and validation logic.

Notes
- Currently uses client-side seeded data—needs loader implementation once vendor settings models are available.
- All mutations are client-side only—needs API integration once backend actions are ready.
- TODO comment in loader indicates future API integration.
- State management uses `useState` hooks with cloned arrays/objects to avoid mutations.
- Dialog forms validate required fields before submission.
- Toast notifications provide user feedback for all actions.
- Consider adding edit functionality for existing accounts/documents in future iterations.
- Consider adding file upload for compliance documents in future iterations.
