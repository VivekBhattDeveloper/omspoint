Route file: web/routes/_app.seller.assortments._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/seller/assortments

Role/Purpose
- Provide seller-facing assortment management interface with template management, guardrail policies, and approval workflows.
- Enable sellers to manage product assortments, configure templates, monitor guardrail coverage, and track approvals.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Assortments" and description.
- Summary metric cards: Active assortments, Guardrail coverage, Pending approvals, Templates in flight.
- Custom `Table` components showing assortment templates, guardrail policies, and approval requests.
- Template table: Name, Cadence, Channels, Guardrails, Owner, Status.
- Guardrail policies table: Name, Coverage, Description, Status, Gaps.
- Approval requests table: Template, Action, Status, Due date.
- Status badges: live, review, draft, healthy, attention, planning, approved, waiting, scheduled.
- Action buttons: Create template, Edit, Approve, Reject.

Data Dependencies
- Currently uses client-side sample data (no loader yet).
- Sample data includes: summary metrics, template rows, guardrail policies, approval requests.
- Data defined as constants and computed from sample structures.

Actions & Side Effects
- Create template button: Opens template creation dialog (stub implementation).
- Edit button: Opens template editing dialog (stub implementation).
- Approve/Reject buttons: Update approval status (client-side state updates, toast feedback).
- No mutations yet—page is read-only monitoring view with stub actions.

Acceptance Criteria
- Page renders with sample data showing assortment metrics, templates, and policies.
- Summary metrics display correctly (active assortments, coverage, approvals, templates).
- Template table displays all relevant fields with correct formatting.
- Guardrail policies table shows coverage percentages and status.
- Approval requests table displays pending approvals with due dates.
- Status badges display with correct colors based on status values.
- Action buttons trigger appropriate dialogs or state updates.
- Empty states handle gracefully when no templates/policies exist.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Verify all sections load with sample data.
- Manual: Test create template action (stub implementation).
- Manual: Test edit template action (stub implementation).
- Manual: Test approve/reject actions update state correctly.
- Manual: Check status badge colors match record status.
- Future: Add loader to fetch real assortment data from API once models are available.
- Future: Add API mutations for template and approval operations once backend is ready.
- Future: Add unit tests for approval workflow logic.

Notes
- Currently uses client-side sample data—needs loader implementation once assortment models are available.
- Status badge configurations use consistent color schemes across all sections.
- Guardrail policies provide compliance monitoring for assortments.
- Approval workflows ensure quality control before publishing.
- Consider adding real-time approval status updates in future iterations.
- Consider adding bulk template operations in future iterations.
- Consider adding guardrail policy configuration in future iterations.
