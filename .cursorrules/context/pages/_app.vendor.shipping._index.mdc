Title: _app.vendor.shipping._index page
Route file: web/routes/_app.vendor.shipping._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/vendor/shipping

Role/Purpose
- Provide vendor-facing shipment tracking interface with search and method filtering.
- Enable vendors to monitor outbound shipments, track carrier methods, and navigate to shipment details for updates.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Shipping" and description.
- `Card` wrapping shipment table with header and description.
- Search `Input` for filtering by tracking number or order ID (client-side).
- Method filter `Select` (All methods, Ground, Air, Express).
- Optional `Alert` banner when `isSample === true` showing "Sample dataset" message with error details.
- Custom `Table` component from `@/components/ui/table` with columns: Tracking #, Method, Shipment date, Order.
- Table rows are keyboard accessible and clickable, navigating to detail page.
- Method badges display with capitalized formatting.

Data Dependencies
- Loader calls `context.api.shipment.findMany()` with select: `id`, `trackingNumber`, `shipmentMethod`, `shipmentDate`, `order.orderId`.
- Sorted by `shipmentDate: "Descending"`, limited to `first: 250`.
- On error, returns `sampleShipments` array (3 curated records) with `isSample: true` and `errorMessage`.
- Shipments mapped to `LoaderShipment` type with normalized values.

Actions & Side Effects
- Search input filters shipments client-side by tracking number or order ID (case-insensitive, trimmed).
- Method filter filters shipments by shipment method (client-side).
- Table row click/keyboard activation navigates to `/vendor/shipping/:id`.
- Alert displays when showing sample data with error message surfaced.
- Filters work together (both search and method must match).

Acceptance Criteria
- Loader handles API success and failure gracefully with sample data fallback.
- Sample data fallback shows alert with error message when API unavailable.
- Search filters shipments by tracking number or order ID correctly.
- Method filter filters shipments correctly and works with search.
- Table renders tracking numbers, method badges, formatted dates, and order IDs.
- Date formatting uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with medium date and short time styles.
- Row click/keyboard navigation works correctly to detail page.
- Empty state shows "No shipments match the current filters." when filtered array is empty.
- Method badges display with capitalized formatting (replaces hyphens with spaces).

QA & Tests
- Manual: Simulate API failure to verify sample data + alert appears.
- Manual: Test search filtering with various tracking numbers and order IDs.
- Manual: Test method filter with various methods.
- Manual: Test combined search + method filter.
- Manual: Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space) on table rows.
- Manual: Verify row click navigates to detail page.
- Unit: Test filtering logic with edge cases (empty search, no method filter, etc.).
- E2E: Test full flow from list → search → filter → detail navigation.

Notes
- Loader implements robust error handling with sample data fallback pattern.
- Custom Table component used instead of AutoTable for better control and accessibility.
- Client-side filtering for responsive UX without server round-trips.
- Method badge helper function formats method names consistently.
- Consider pagination when shipment volume exceeds 250 records.
- Consider server-side filtering if volume grows significantly.
