Title: _app.vendor.printers._index page
Route file: web/routes/_app.vendor.printers._index.tsx
Suggested path: /app/vendor/printers

Role/Purpose
- Provide vendor-facing printer fleet management interface with printer status, maintenance scheduling, and jig template management.
- Enable vendors to monitor printer health, track maintenance tasks, and manage jig templates.

Primary UI Components
- `PageHeader` with title "Printer Fleet" and description.
- Search `Input` for filtering printers by label, ID, vendor, or location.
- Status filter `Select` (All, Online, Maintenance due, Calibration scheduled, Offline).
- Substrate filter `Select` (All, plus unique substrates from printer fleet).
- `Tabs` component with three tabs: Printers, Maintenance, Jig Templates.
- Custom `Table` components in each tab showing relevant records with status badges and formatted values.
- Printers table: Label, Vendor, Location, Status, Uptime, Capacity/hour, Supported substrates, Last maintenance, Next maintenance, Queue backlog.
- Maintenance table: Printer, Task, Type, Due date, Due in days, Owner, Status, Notes.
- Jig Templates table: Label, Media type, Dimensions, Thickness, Tolerance, Status, Last validated, Supported printers.
- Status badges with color coding: Online=secondary, Maintenance due/Calibration scheduled=outline, Offline=destructive, In progress=default, Pending parts=destructive, Scheduled=outline, Completed=secondary, Approved=secondary, Pending QA=outline, Draft=destructive.

Data Dependencies
- Currently uses client-side sample data (no loader yet).
- Sample data includes: printer fleet (5 printers), maintenance tasks (4 tasks), jig templates (5 templates).
- Data defined as constants (`printerFleet`, `maintenanceTasks`, `jigTemplates`).
- Filters computed via `useMemo` hooks for search, status, and substrate filtering.

Actions & Side Effects
- Search input filters printers client-side by label, ID, vendor, or location (case-insensitive, trimmed).
- Status filter filters printers by status (client-side).
- Substrate filter filters printers by supported substrates (client-side).
- Tab switching updates visible content (client-side).
- Filters work together (all filters must match).
- No mutations yet—page is read-only monitoring view.

Acceptance Criteria
- Page renders with sample data showing printers, maintenance tasks, and jig templates.
- Search filters printers correctly across multiple fields.
- Status filter filters printers correctly.
- Substrate filter filters printers correctly.
- Filters work together (all filters must match).
- Tabs switch correctly between all three categories.
- Status badges display with correct colors/variants based on status values.
- Empty states handle gracefully when no records match filters.

QA & Tests
- Manual: Verify all three tabs load and display data correctly.
- Manual: Test search filtering with various terms.
- Manual: Test status filter with various statuses.
- Manual: Test substrate filter with various substrates.
- Manual: Test combined search + status + substrate filters.
- Manual: Test tab switching between all categories.
- Manual: Check status badge colors/variants match record status.
- Future: Add loader to fetch real printer data from API once models are available.
- Future: Add unit tests for filtering logic.

Notes
- Currently uses client-side sample data—needs loader implementation once printer models are available.
- Status badge helper functions provide consistent formatting across all tabs.
- Client-side filtering for responsive UX without server round-trips.
- Substrate filter dynamically generates options from printer fleet data.
- Consider pagination when printer volume exceeds manageable size.
- Consider server-side filtering if volume grows significantly.
- Consider adding mutation actions (update printer status, schedule maintenance) in future iterations.
